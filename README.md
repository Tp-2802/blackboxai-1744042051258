# PHP Authentication Website

## Project Overview
The PHP Authentication Website is a simple web application that provides user registration, login, and two-factor authentication functionalities. Built using PHP and MySQL with support for PDO (PHP Data Objects), this project aims to demonstrate secure user authentication best practices.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd php-authentication-website
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**
   - Ensure you have a local server with PHP and MySQL (like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP).
   - Create a new database named `auth_website` in your MySQL instance.
   - Update the database configuration in `config.php` if necessary.

3. **Run the Application**
   - Place the project folder in the local server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Access the application in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost/php-authentication-website/index.php`.

## Usage
- **Sign Up**: Create a new user account by providing a username, email, and password.
- **Sign In**: Log in using your registered credentials. If two-factor authentication is enabled, you will be prompted to enter a verification token.
- **Profile**: After signing in, users can view their profile information.
- **Logout**: Users can log out, which will terminate their session.

## Features
- User registration with email and password validation.
- Secure password storage using password hashing.
- Login functionality with optional two-factor authentication (2FA).
- User profile page displaying username and email.
- Responsive design leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following dependencies as found in `package.json` (if applicable):
- **PHP 7.4 or higher**: Ensure you have the required PHP version installed.
- **MySQL**: For database management.

*(Note: No specific package.json was provided; PHP dependencies typically won't be in this file.)*
